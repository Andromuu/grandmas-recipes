This repository contains the first project of The Odin Project, related to HTML.

Through the following project I have reviewed my notions of HTML and learned, above all, how to use Git, a tool that I had not used since I studied Web Application Development in 2019.

I hope to continue this learning and create better projects to build my portfolio.
