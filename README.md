This repository contains the first project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">The Odin Project</a>, related to **HTML**.

Through the following project I have reviewed my notions of **_HTML_** and learned, above all, how to use **_Git_**, a tool that I had not used since I studied Web Application Development in 2019.

I hope to continue this learning and create better projects to build my portfolio. 

*Sorry if this README.md isn't that pretty, I'm learning to format it as well for future larger projects.*
